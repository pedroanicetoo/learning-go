// Concurrence != Parallel computing
/*
	`Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously.
	Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.`

	`Parallel computing is closely related to concurrent computingâ€”they are frequently used together, and often conflated,
	though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency,
	and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU).
	In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down into several, often many,
	very similar sub-tasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion.
	In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks;
	when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often
	require some inter-process communication during execution.`
